This is a basic example of making JavaScript files with Gulp and Browserify. It also has a small tests of calling dependencies (like jQuery and Lodash) and a boilerplate of JS for a containerized component.

### Start it up

```
npm install
gulp
```

Open `result/index.html` in a browser and check the console.
